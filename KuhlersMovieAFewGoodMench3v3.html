<h2>Plot</h2>
<p>At Guantanamo Marine Base, a private is attacked by 2 other marines and dies as a result. 
	An investigation is conducted by Lt. Commander Jo Galloway and reveals to her superiors 
	that she believes that the private was attacked by because he was going over the head of 
	Colonel Jessup, the base commander and was threatening to reveal something unless he gets 
	a transfer, so Jessup ordered a "code red" which is basically a type hazing done which 
	is not legal. Galloway wants to be assigned to defend the 2 marines but her superior 
	prefers that the whole go away quietly so he denies her request and has the case assigned 
	to Lt. Dan Kaffee, a Naval lawyer who hasn't tried a case in court and prefers to plea his 
	cases out. But Galloway warns him that if he pleads the case out, Jessup will get away 
	with murder. Kaffee decides not to plead the case out and tries to defend them but there's 
	no proof that Jessup actually gave the order.</p>
